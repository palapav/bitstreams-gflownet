# bitstreams-gflownet
An implemenetation of a Generative Flow Network (GFlowNet) for sampling a sequence of bits via the trajectory balance objective. <br>
Code is adapted from Emmanuel Bengio's Google Colab tutorial for implementing a GFlowNet. <br>
TO-DOs:
<ul>
  <li>Modularize design</li>
  <li>Vectorize to sample N trajectories at once</li>
  <li>Store training result graphs</li>
</ul>
