1. See why nn.Linear() expects input of float32 but the error that occurs
is RuntimeError: expected scalar type Long but found Float

Reproduced error:

tensor = torch.LongTensor([1, 2, 3, 4])
layer_1 = torch.Linear(4, 5)
output = layer_1(tensor)


2. Check flow mismatch loss -> make sense of it more

3. Investigate -> Evaluation results gathered during training

4. How to continue to generate data without training the GFlowNet



# plot reward over training for sampled bit strings
# reduce length of bit string
# flows should be strictly decreasing
# parametrized the log of the flow (get rid of exp)
# save the model weights (trained GFlowNet)


refactor validate_train in eval.py


variable function in range
