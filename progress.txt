1. See why nn.Linear() expects input of float32 but the error that occurs
is RuntimeError: expected scalar type Long but found Float

Reproduced error:

tensor = torch.LongTensor([1, 2, 3, 4])
layer_1 = torch.Linear(4, 5)
output = layer_1(tensor)


2. Check flow mismatch loss -> make sense of it more
